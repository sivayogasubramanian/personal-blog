## Useful Python Functions

#### `divmod(m, n)`

```python
m, n = 12, 4

quotient, remainder = divmod(m,n)

print(quotient) # 3
print(remainder) # 0
```

#### `zip(l1, l2)`

```python
l1, l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]

print(zip(l1, l2)) # [(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8)]
```

#### dictionary.setdefault(key, default)

```python

# The setdefault() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.
# If the key does not exist, insert the key, with the specified value, see example below

x = car.setdefault("model", "Bronco")

```

## Bit Manipulation

| Bit Operation | What it Does                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| x ^ x         | Always equals to 0               |
| x & (x - 1)   | Sets the rightmost bit of x to 0 |

## Heaps

Heaps (or priority queues) are a data structure that can be used to implement a queue with a priority. By default, the heap is a min heap, but you can change it to a max heap by negating.

```python
import heapq

heap = []

# Push the value item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.
heappush(heap, item)

# Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.
# If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised.
# To access the smallest item without popping it, use heap[0].
heappop(heap, item)

# Push item on the heap, then pop and return the smallest item from the heap.
# The combined action runs more efficiently
# than heappush() followed by a separate call to heappop().
heappushpop(heap, item)

# Transform list x into a heap, in-place, in linear time.
heapify(heap)

# Pop and return the smallest item from the heap,
# and also push the new item. The heap size doesn’t change.
# If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised.

# This one step operation is more efficient than a heappop()
# followed by heappush() and can be more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap.
# The pop/push combination always returns an element from the heap
# and replaces it with item.

# The value returned may be larger than the item added.
# If that isn’t desired, consider using heappushpop() instead.
# Its push/pop combination returns the smaller of the two values,
# leaving the larger value on the heap.
heapreplace(heap, item)

# Return a list with the n largest elements from the dataset defined by iterable.
# key, if provided, specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract
# a comparison key from each element in iterable (for example, key=str.lower).
# Equivalent to: sorted(iterable, key=key, reverse=True)[:n].
nlargest(n, iterable, key=None)

# Return a list with the n smallest elements from the dataset defined by iterable.
# key, if provided, specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract
# a comparison key from each element in iterable
# (for example, key=str.lower). Equivalent to: sorted(iterable, key=key)[:n].
nsmallest(n, iterable, key=None)
```

## Utility Functions

#### Get midpoint of a list

```python
def mid(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
  slow, fast = head, head

  while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next

  return slow
```

#### Reverse a list

```python
def reverse(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
  if head is None or head.next is None:
    return head

  reversed_list = self.reverse(head.next)
  head.next.next = head
  head.next = None

  return reversed_list
```

## Common Pitfalls

When an `Optional` type is used, the way we check for `None` is different.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_balanced(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
  if not root: return True # Will not work
  if root is None: return True # Correct check

  left_height = self.height(root.left)
  right_height = self.height(root.right)

  return abs(left_height - right_height) <= 1
```
